# airtight.js
A small JavaScript testing framework that is expressive and easy to read.

This small project was developed as a simple JS framework for unit testing
for [Meugle](https://github.com/theDragonFire/meugle). Because Meugle was
simply a small project that I was working on, I didn't want to dive into a
full-on testing framework like [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/). So I developed
**airtight.js** based on the process found in *Test-Driven Development by
Example* by Kent Beck. Tests are easy to set up and the output is easy to read.
